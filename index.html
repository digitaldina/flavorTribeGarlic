   <p> Happy Birthday Christina!</p>

<p>I want to thank you for being such a great mentor and colleague this summer. You’ve guided and supported me throughout my time working at Hack Club
which has been the greatest experience. You’re someone I look up to also for your work and influence outside of Hack Club. Thank you so much for the patience,
advice, and encouragement that you’ve given me.</p>

<p>Happy birthday Christina!</p>

<p>Since you joined in February, Hack Club started to never be the same. The relentlessness, kindness, and thoughtful leadership you've brought to Hack Club make us better every day.</p>

<p>I can't think of a better person to be running this org with. I'm so glad to have you as a teammate and as a friend.</p>

<br><p>Happy Birthday Christina! I feel so fortunate that I met you this summer. You have been a great role model to me and I’m forever grateful. I hope this year is the best year yet.<p>

<p>Hey Christina!<p>

 <p> When Zach called me a while ago to talk about bringing you onto the team, I was psyched. Your track record as a professional spoke for itself, you had amazing potential to bring some much needed direction to the team, and you sounded like a perfect fit. You have done— and been—all of that and more. May your birthday today be as exceptional as you are, I’m excited to work together more in the future.</p>

    <p>Happy Birthday Christina! I am so honored that I've been able to work with you this past Summer and empower over 370 students in technology. Your willingness to help others around you has helped me see the power of community in STEM and I'm grateful to have you as a role model to look up to. Thank you so much for always believing in me and dedicating your time to hearing about an idea I came up with on a whim. I'm so excited to see you take to Hack Club to even greater heights and work with you in the future! I hope you have a great day :) </p>
