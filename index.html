   <p> Happy Birthday Christina!</p>

<p>I want to thank you for being such a great mentor and colleague this summer. You’ve guided and supported me throughout my time working at Hack Club
which has been the greatest experience. You’re someone I look up to also for your work and influence outside of Hack Club. Thank you so much for the patience,
advice, and encouragement that you’ve given me.</p>

<p>Happy birthday Christina!</p>

<p>Since you joined in February, Hack Club started to never be the same. The relentlessness, kindness, and thoughtful leadership you've brought to Hack Club make us better every day.</p>

<p>I can't think of a better person to be running this org with. I'm so glad to have you as a teammate and as a friend.</p>

<br><p>Happy Birthday Christina! I feel so fortunate that I met you this summer. You have been a great role model to me and I’m forever grateful. I hope this year is the best year yet.<p>

<p>Hey Christina!<p>

 <p> When Zach called me a while ago to talk about bringing you onto the team, I was psyched. Your track record as a professional spoke for itself, you had amazing potential to bring some much needed direction to the team, and you sounded like a perfect fit. You have done— and been—all of that and more. May your birthday today be as exceptional as you are, I’m excited to work together more in the future.</p>
